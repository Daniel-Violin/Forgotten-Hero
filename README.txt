Design Choices:

I had to make some changes to the main idea of the game since I submitted milestone 1. Instead of having different types of powerups as the vehicles
I learned that doing so would take away from the main "idea" of the game as described in the specifications (this was cleared up by Skyler and then Robert).

So, the main vehicles are bats that the player can take control of to move their player around. I believe that I managed to stick to the main theme
of overcoming challenges with vehicles I described in milestone 1. Also, I removed larks entirely because they did not really fit in my theme. Instead I
added terrain based obstacles such as lava, spikes and fan's that serve as challenges to the player.

Lastly I didnt have the opportunity to add sound effects or music (unfortunately), I could not get it working in the time we were allotted. 

->I made the collision of a mounted player and spikes more forgiving (to make it a bit less frustrating)
->The friction is still set to .99, the bats slide all around the map and it is more difficult to collect the gems with friction this low,
  if you want an easier time during testing you can set the friction to .75
->The bat controls are a tad confusing (I changed them a little from the original game), Pressing the up key moves you in the direction the bat's head is 
  facing regardless of which direction the head is. Pressing the down key moves you in the direction of the bat's tail.

Overall, I had a pretty good time making it and hope you have a fun time playing.
